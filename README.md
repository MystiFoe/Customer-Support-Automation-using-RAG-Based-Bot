```

## üîß Configuration

Customize the application by editing `config/settings.py`:

```python
@dataclass
class OpenAIConfig:
    model: str = "gpt-4o"           # AI model to use
    temperature: float = 0.7         # Response creativity (0-1)
    max_tokens: int = 500           # Maximum response length

@dataclass
class UIConfig:
    page_title: str = "AI Customer Support"
    layout: str = "wide"            # Streamlit layout mode
```

## üìä Performance Metrics

The system automatically tracks key performance indicators:

- **Accuracy Rate**: Response quality based on confidence scores and source relevance
- **Resolution Rate**: Percentage of queries successfully resolved without escalation
- **Response Time**: Average time to generate AI responses
- **Source Attribution**: Transparency showing which knowledge base articles informed responses

## üéØ Use Cases

### Customer Support Teams
- Automate responses to frequently asked questions
- Provide consistent 24/7 support availability
- Reduce first response times and improve customer satisfaction
- Free up human agents for complex issues requiring personal attention

### Technical Documentation
- Create interactive help systems for software products
- Provide instant access to technical knowledge bases
- Support internal teams with quick procedure lookups

### Business Applications

## üîç How It Works

1. **Query Processing**: User submits a question through the professional web interface
2. **Document Retrieval**: RAG system searches the knowledge base using keyword matching and scoring
3. **Context Generation**: Most relevant documents are combined with the user query
4. **AI Response**: OpenAI's GPT-4 generates a contextual response using retrieved information
5. **Quality Tracking**: System logs performance metrics, confidence scores, and source attribution

## üìà Monitoring & Analytics

- **Real-time Dashboard**: Live performance metrics displayed in the sidebar
- **Conversation Export**: Download complete chat history and metrics in JSON format
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed application logs for system monitoring and debugging
- **Performance Tracking**: Historical data analysis for continuous system optimization

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**OpenAI API Key Error**
```bash
# Ensure your API key is properly set
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-actual-api-key"
# Or add to your shell profile for persistence
echo 'export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-key"' >> ~/.bashrc
```

**Port Already in Use**
```bash
# Use a different port
poetry run streamlit run app.py --server.port 8502
# Or kill existing processes
pkill -f streamlit
```

**Knowledge Base Not Loading**
- Ensure `data/knowledge_base.json` exists and is readable
- Verify JSON format is valid using online JSON validators
- Check file permissions and directory structure

**Dependencies Issues**
```bash
# Clear Poetry cache and reinstall
poetry cache clear pypi --all
poetry install --no-cache
```

### Logging and Debugging
Check application logs for detailed error information:
```bash
# View recent logs
tail -f logs/app.log

# Search for specific errors
grep "ERROR" logs/app.log

# Monitor logs in real-time
tail -f logs/app.log | grep -E "(ERROR|WARNING)"
```
